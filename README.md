# hello-world
Test Repository
Hello friends! My real name is Minanshu but you can call me kryptokinght which is pronounced as kryptonite. Don't mind the spelling, that dosen't have any meaning. For future refrences, I think Github will show the date on which i edited this Readme file. So if you are reading this in the future, I might be a famous programmer by then or I might not exist. But for now, I am a first year student of NIT Durgapur which is in INDIA and is a college of national repute. Right now my aim is to get into open source programming so as to participate in Google Summer of Code and also to learn competitive coding. The languages which i know well enough and currently i am learning are java, html, c and c++(both are basically the same), and finally python. That's all my friends for now. I will update this readme as i progress.
You can contact me on my email-id: minanshu.1998@gmail.com
