# hello-world
Test Repository
Hello friends! My real name is Minanshu Singh but you can call me kryptokinght which is pronounced as kryptonite. Don't mind the spelling, that dosen't have any meaning. For future refrences, I think Github will show the date on which i edited this Readme file. So if you are reading this in the future, I might be a famous programmer by then or I might not exist. But for now, I am a first year student of NIT Durgapur. Right now my aim is to understand the open source world. The languages which i know well enough and currently i am learning are java, html, c and c++(both are basically the same), and finally python. That's all my friends for now. I will update this readme as i progress.
You can contact me on my email-id: minanshu.1998@gmail.com
update 11/7/17 :
I have started learning web development with the help of freeCodeCamp tutorials. I have added a new language to my portfolio- javascript.
